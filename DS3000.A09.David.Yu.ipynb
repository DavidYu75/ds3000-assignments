    "## Overview\n",
    "The k-Nearest neighbor method is a type of instance based learning that uses existing data, with known labels, to predict the label for a new observation. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the use of k-NN for classification using the [iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). \n",

    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use the notebook: `k-NN.ipynb` to perform the following:\n",
    "Question 1. Load and Inspect the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2. Perform the k-nn analysis using different values of k. Recommend which value is more appropriate and justify your response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3. Evaluate the prediction accuracy of the k-nn model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4. Explore different metrics and data partitioning strategies.\n"

    "\n",
    "The `ipynb` format stores outputs from the last time you ran the notebook.  (When you open a notebook it has the figures and outputs of the last time you ran it too).  To ensure that your submitted `ipynb` file represents your latest code, make sure to give a fresh run `Kernel > Restart & Run All` just before uploading the `ipynb` file.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Writing your homework is an individual effort.**  You may discuss general python problems with other students but under no circumstances should you observe another student's code which was written for this assignment, from this year or past years.  Pop into office hours or DM us in MS Teams if you have a specific question about your work or if you would like another pair of eyes or talk through your code.\n",
    "\n",

For more information, read the following article [How to Write Beautiful Python Code With PEP 8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/) or ask your TA's for tips.\n",
